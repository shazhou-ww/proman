# Changelog

## 0.9.0 — 2026-06-13

- Refactor proman into a monorepo with `@shazhou/proman-core` and `@shazhou/proman` packages.
  
  **Breaking**: None - CLI interface remains unchanged
  
  **New packages**:
  - `@shazhou/proman-core` - Core library with config loader, utils, and command logic as pure functions for programmatic use
  - `@shazhou/proman` - CLI package that parses args and delegates to core functions
  
  **Features**:
  - Proman now manages itself as a monorepo (dogfooding)
  - Single-package projects work as one-package monorepos (eliminates need for unirepo support)
  - Core exports are pure functions with no CLI-specific side effects
  - Root `proman.yaml` configures packages array for monorepo management
  
  **Migration**: Users only need to upgrade the `@shazhou/proman` CLI package. The core package is automatically installed as a dependency.
- Migrate tests from root to package-specific directories and fix monorepo dependencies
  
  - Migrate all test files from root `tests/` to `packages/core/tests/` and `packages/cli/tests/`
  - Update test imports to reference correct package structure
  - Remove `yaml` dependency from root package.json (now only in core package where it's used)
  - Fix workflow schema test paths to reference root `.workflows/` directory
